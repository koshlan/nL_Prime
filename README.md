How is the sort performed?

Sorting is done stepwise. The columns (1-indexed for the UNIX bash shell) are:
30 : Oracle Penalty (this penalty is based on the Oracle program; more details to follow below)
12 : Inclusivity of the all of the desired <inclusion set> allowing for 2 total mismatches
10 : Inclusitivy of the of the desired <inclusion set> allowing for 0 total mismatches
2 : Thermo dynamic penalty assessed by primer3 based on self-dimerization, hetero-dimerization, GC richness, ect.
